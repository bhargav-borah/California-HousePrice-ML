# House-Price-Prediction-Model
Machine learning models to predict the price of property. It is trained on California Housing Prices data set.
The models based on XGB Regression and CatBoost Regression produced the best results.
Decision Tree model overfit the data and performed poorly in predicting unseen data.
Random Forest model also overfit the data, as can be seen in its much worse performance in predicting unseen data.
The other models performed better than Decision Tree and Random Forest Regression, but coulnd't match XGB and CatBoost Regression
